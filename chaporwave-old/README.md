# chaporwave

How many colors or patterns combinations can you make without making any mistakes? Combine the right teabags! Whether the pattern or the color match, the cloud will tell you what the bunny is looking for. And beware! You only have 3 lives to spend, but do it before the tea spills, or it will be too late!

# lessons learned:

Developing chaporwave was one the best experience that we have ever had in Programming. It made a big difference for the designer to be able to follow most of the developing process and understand what was happening to the point of being able to help. We learned so much about app architecture, using Cocoapods and CoreHaptics. We loved having people from all around the world interact with us through Social media. The design project is full of ours preferences and the result we were able to achieve is extremely satisfying for both of us.
